* Store name- Flint
<br>
*What are you selling- Camping Product
<br>
* What additional page(s) did you add? How to operate them-
<br>
1. Rating Product-We created a "rating" function, the function makes validations from
the frontend data . Moreover gets a rating between 1-5 (int only) , and the product's id and look it up in Redis.
Then it check if the user already voted or not.if didn't vote adds the new rating to sum and calculate the average of rating.
the user did vote, edits the existing vote
In both cases update in DB and displays the new rating
<br>
2. Edit Product- We created a "editproduct" function , the function allows the admin the edit an existing product ,
by giving to this function, few params the product id, a field and a new value.
Then it checks the validity of the new value given according to
the field given(like the image in the folder), and doesn't allow to add new values to the product. Then it updates the DB. Moreover not every field can be updated
like product'id, rating, and more.
